# Effects of auditory priming on the perception of semantic and syntactic inconsistencies in a virtual environment
 
This is a study which was done in the scope of the "Designing and conducting an EEG study in VR" course from the University of Osnabrück.

The aim of this study was to test the effects of auditory priming on the perception of semantic and syntactic inconsistencies in the visual domain in a VR environment. Participants were immersed in a virtual environment, a green landscape, in which they were following a path. The participant saw in total eight stimuli for which the audio priming was either congruent to the object (e.g. Audio: “Do you see the tree over there?”/ object visually displayed: tree) or incongruent (e.g. Audio: “Do you see the tree over there?”/ object visually displayed: house). The visual object was additionally either congruent to the laws of physics or incongruent (displayed up-side down). In the study two different objects got useed: Tree and house.

The VR experiment was custom-made and conducted with the help of Unity.

The data analysis was done with Python.
